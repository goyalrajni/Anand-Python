In India, the introduction of systems based on information technology for monitoring and
controlling canal operations is necessary to improve water management not only at the operational
level but also at the farm level. Upgrading existing canal system operations needs to be done in
different stages. It can be done in small areas which are easily and economically assessable for
improvement. The cost of canal automation on an existing irrigation project and that on a new project
cannot be compared, as the built-in constraints in the existing project not only limit the degree
of automation but also increase the cost by way of remodeling the existing canal systems. The
management of irrigation in India differs conceptually from that practiced in those developed countries
where limited water is not a constraint. Good management, efficient operation and well-executed
maintenance of irrigation systems are essential to the success and sustainability of irrigated agriculture.
They result in better performance, better crop yields and sustained production. One of the key
objectives in the management of an irrigation system is to provide levels of service as agreed with the
relevant government authorities and the consumers at the minimum achievable cost. The computation
of the benefits of an automation project is quite complex. An automation project is undertaken to
improve irrigation systems so that they can meet enhanced operating criteria. Usually this implies
increased water volumes and improvements in conveyance, distribution and application efficiency.
