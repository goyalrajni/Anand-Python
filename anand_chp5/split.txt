In the present scenario of Irrigation , effective operation of the canals by minimizing wastage of water
is the most important problem faced by the Engineers. This problem can be solved to a great extent by
canalautomation. Automation of canals is achieved by means of canal control algorithms.
Fuzzy Logic based canal control algorithm will be an efficient tool for calculating inflow discharge
release needed to maintain target water levels in canals. To Solve thisCivil Engineering based problem,
Computer Science Department can contribute towards development of a corresponding Control
software , which will effectively do allthe calculations in minimum time.
In India, the introduction of systems based on information technology for monitoring and
controlling canal operations is necessary to improve water management not only at the operational
level but also at the farm level. Upgrading existing canal system operations needs to be done in
different stages. It can be done in small areas which are easily and economically assessable for
improvement. The cost of canal automation on an existing irrigation project and that on a new project
